# jex
An experimental language with a fresh look at functional OOP.

Jex (meaning /one/ in Gypsy) is an experimental programming language that explores some fresh ideas around functional and object-oriented programming. In my 10 or so years of professional software development, I've spent many long hours daydreaming about new patterns and paradigms for programming and Jex is my first attempt at making something out of those various ideas.

## Disclaimers^(please^be^nice)

* This is an experimental language. Do not use or it will harm your babies.
* I do have a Ph.D. in computer science but in an unrelated field. I'm not up to date with current programming language research; so I essentially have no idea what I'm doing.
* The ideas presented here may be described in other forms in prior art. I'm not aware that this is the case (as I haven't looked) but I'd be keen to know of any similar efforts.
* I'm doing this 100% for fun, and I will most probably abandon this project in a week or so.
